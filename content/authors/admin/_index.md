  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and software development. I enjoy solving tough problems and working on exciting projects that use technology to help others. I believe in the power of innovation to create solutions that make life easier and better for people.

Outside of studies, I love playing music, staying active with running and yoga, and reading about different cultures and history. Exploring new ideas and experiences helps me stay creative and open-minded. My mix of technical skills, curiosity, and hobbies keeps me motivated to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects.
